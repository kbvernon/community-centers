  abstract = {Serious concerns with accelerating global warming have been translated into urgent calls for increasing urban densities: higher densities are associated with lower greenhouse gas emissions, especially those related to vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT). In order to densify meaningfully in the coming decades, cities need to make room within their existing footprints to accommodate more people. In the absence of adequate room within their existing footprints, cities create more room through outward expansion, typically resulting in lower overall densities. We introduce a quantitative dimension to this process, focusing on the population added to a global stratified sample of 200 cities between 1990 and 2014. In three-quarters of the cities we studied, the areas built before 1990 gained population and thus densified significantly. On average, however, only one-quarter of the total population added to the 200 cities in the sample in the 1990–2014 period were accommodated within their 1990 urban footprints, while three-quarters were accommodated within their newly built expansion areas. That resulted in an overall decline in average urban densities during the 1990–2014 period despite the near-global, decades-old and rarely questioned consensus that urban expansion must be contained.},

  abstract = {Maize is the New World’s preeminent grain crop and it provided the economic basis for human culture in many regions within the Americas. To flourish, maize needs water, sunlight (heat), and nutrients (e.g., nitrogen). In this paper, climate and soil chemistry data are used to evaluate the potential for dryland (rain-on-field) agriculture in the semiarid southeastern Colorado Plateau and Rio Grande regions. Processes that impact maize agriculture such as nitrogen mineralization, infiltration of precipitation, bare soil evaporation, and transpiration are discussed and evaluated. Most of the study area, excepting high-elevation regions, receives sufficient solar radiation to grow maize. The salinities of subsurface soils in the central San Juan Basin are very high and their nitrogen concentrations are very low. In addition, soils of the central San Juan Basin are characterized by pH values that exceed 8.0, which limit the availability of both nitrogen and phosphorous. In general, the San Juan Basin, including Chaco Canyon, is the least promising part of the study area in terms of dryland farming. Calculations of field life, using values of organic nitrogen for the upper 50~cm of soil in the study area, indicate that most of the study area could not support a 10-bushel/acre crop of maize. The concepts, methods, and calculations used to quantify maize productivity in this study are applicable to maize cultivation in other environmental settings across the Americas.}

  abstract = {In agrarian societies, such as the ancestral Pueblo of the Four Corners region of the US Southwest (c. AD 600â1300), the resilience of crops in the face of climate challenges was of paramount concern. Consequently, students of these societies have invested much effort in modeling the response of traditional crops to ancient weather patterns. Less effort has been made to evaluate the quality of those reconstructions with experimental studies. Here, we report on results from the Pueblo Farming Project (PFP), a long-term collaboration between the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center and the Hopi tribe. From 2009 through 2015, PFP researchers and members of the Hopi tribe planted four experimental gardens of Hopi maize (Zea mays) on Crow Canyon's campus in southwestern Colorado using traditional methods. PFP researchers recorded growth progress over the growing season, harvested the corn, measured characteristics of the resulting crop, and derived yield estimates. We present the results of the garden experiments and we compare experimental yields with computational estimates of potential maize yield developed by the Village Ecodynamics Project (VEP). We find that Hopi maize flourishes in this part of the Hopi ancestral land and that PFP experimental yields are highly correlated with VEP yield estimates. We suggest that these PFP data may be used to refine existing maize paleoproductivity estimates, and we propose future directions for farming experiments in the Four Corners.},

  abstract = {One of the critical factors affecting travel rates while hiking, jogging, or running along a trail is the slope of the underlying terrain. Models for predicting this effect have been used in a wide variety of scientific and applied contexts, including recreation planning, search and rescue, wildland firefighter safety, social network analysis, and recreating historical human movement patterns. Despite their wide use, these models are based on datasets with very small sample sizes that were collected without using instantaneous measures of travel rate and assume symmetrical effects about the slope of maximum travel rate. These models also typically resulted in a single mathematical function, ignoring the significant variability that can occur between a fast and a slow individual, or between walking and running travel rates. In this study we modeled travel rates using a database of GPS tracks from 29,928 individuals representing 421,247 individual hikes, jogs, and runs on trails in and around Salt Lake City, Utah for an entire year between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017. Three widely-used probability distribution functions (Laplace, Gauss, and Lorentz) were used to predict travel rates based on terrain slope along segments of trails with uniform slopes. To account for the variability in travel rates between fast and slow movement, a series of travel rate models were generated to predict travel rate percentiles, ranging from the 1st to the 99th, thus providing a flexible basis for predicting travel rates as a function of slope. The large number of samples allowed us to introduce a novel term that accounts for asymmetry in travel rates on uphill and downhill slopes. All three functions performed well, with Lorentz percentile models averaging an R2 of 0.958 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.078 m/s, Laplace with R2 of 0.953 and MAE of 0.088 m/s, and Gauss with R2 of 0.949 and MAE of 0.090 m/s. All three functions performed notably better at estimating lower travel rate percentiles (e.g. 5th: R2Lorentz = 0.941; R2Laplace = 0.940; R2Gauss = 0.934) as compared to higher (e.g. 95th: R2Lorentz = 0.914; R2Laplace = 0.913; R2Gauss = 0.908), indicating greater consistency in walking rates than the fastest running rates. Lorentz outperformed the other functions for the widest range of percentiles (5th, 30th-90th), and thus is recommended for use as a flexible travel rate prediction function. However, Laplace tended to produce the best results at moderately-low travel rate percentiles (10th-25th), suggesting a combination of the two models could produce the highest accuracies. The results of this research provide a sound basis for future studies aiming to estimate travel rates while hiking or running along slopes.},

Our case study focuses on ancestral Tewa Pueblo villages in northern New Mexico. Uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV) and instrument mapping enables us to quantify the volume of adobe architectural rubble and to construct a decomposition model that estimates numbers of rooms and roofed over space. The resulting metric is applied at ten Pueblo villages in the region to ‘rebuild’ architecture, and calculate maximum architectural capacity and the maximum extent of population size. While our focus is on population histories for large Classic period (A.D. 1350–1598) pueblos in the American Southwest, the model and method may be applied to a variety of archaeological contexts worldwide and is not limited to building material, site size, or construction technique.},

Following a consideration of the notion of Chaco, comments are focused on: (1) Chacoan architectural complexes; (2) great house function; (3) settlement clusters and Chacoan communities; and (4) the regional integration of Chaco. Key variables that have been proposed as relevant to the identification of Chacoan communities are examined in some detail and appeals are made to clarify the usage of several terms, including great house, Chaco era, and community. It is argued that an understanding of the archaeological manifestations of Chaco outside Chaco Canyon will require much more systematic survey at a spatial scale sufficient to detect multiple levels of settlement clustering and that more detailed studies of the interactions among Chacoan architectural complexes and their associated residential settlements will provide key insights into the nature of what Ruth Van Dyke calls the ?Chaco experience.?}

We used both fixed and increasing site use life estimates to measure population density and to estimate the size of individual residential communities for the early Pueblo II through late Pueblo III periods. The results reveal that population density increased in the more agriculturally productive central Mesa Verde region but remained stable or declined on its peripheries. Over time, the central Mesa Verde region underwent varied demographic changes, including brief periods of rapid growth; we argue that these brief periods were the result of small-scale, local migrations that reflected shifts in the sociopolitical landscape, rather than concerns with local environmental productivity. Additional analyses of community organization suggests that relatively small and dispersed sites made up an important part of the Mesa Verde region social landscape even after the formation of nucleated villages.}

  abstract = {The MaxEnt software package is one of the most popular tools for species distribution and environmental niche modeling, with over 1000 published applications since 2006. Its popularity is likely for two reasons: 1) MaxEnt typically outperforms other methods based on predictive accuracy and 2) the software is particularly easy to use. MaxEnt users must make a number of decisions about how they should select their input data and choose from a wide variety of settings in the software package to build models from these data. The underlying basis for making these decisions is unclear in many studies, and default settings are apparently chosen, even though alternative settings are often more appropriate. In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of how MaxEnt works and a prospectus on modeling options to enable users to make informed decisions when preparing data, choosing settings and interpreting output. We explain how the choice of background samples reflects prior assumptions, how nonlinear functions of environmental variables (features) are created and selected, how to account for environmentally biased sampling, the interpretation of the various types of model output and the challenges for model evaluation. We demonstrate MaxEnt’s calculations using both simplified simulated data and occurrence data from South Africa on species of the flowering plant family Proteaceae. Throughout, we show how MaxEnt’s outputs vary in response to different settings to highlight the need for making biologically motivated modeling decisions.}

The problem is especially acute when one is working with sites inhabited across multiple chronological periods and the production curves for pottery types are unknown. In this paper, I present a Bayesian statistical method which I call uniform probability density analysis that is tailored to this situation. This method combines uniform distributions derived from the local pottery chronology with pottery assemblage data to reconstruct the population history of individual settlements. I also illustrate applications of this method at the site and regional level using data from Cuyamungue and the surrounding Tewa Basin/VEP II New Mexico project area. The results allow one to identify a period of significant population movement corresponding to the period of Tewa ethnogenesis in the thirteenth century CE.}

  abstract = {ABSTRACT For the Archaeology of Human Experience to have an impact on public policy, archaeologists need to identify what contemporary society values, determine the extent to which ancient societies provided these values, and examine what it was that enabled certain societies to provide them better than others. I develop a case study of this approach focusing on the famous ?collapse? of Mesa Verde society and subsequent formation of ancestral Tewa society in the 13th century C.E. I translate the archaeological record into measures that reflect the United Nations Development Programme's dimensions of human security to show that ancestral Tewa society eventually met basic human needs better than Mesa Verde society had done. I also present archaeological, linguistic, and cultural evidence that argues the ultimate driver of enhanced security was conceptual change during the migration period. This example suggests ideas play important roles in structuring behavioral habits and thus long-term social outcomes.},

  abstract = {Ceramic seriation is one of the primary tools used by archaeologists to create chronologies, especially for surface survey data. In this article, we outline a bootstrapped approach to correspondence analysis-based seriation designed to help assess and improve the stability of relative orderings produced through such analyses. This procedure systematically identifies and removes small samples and sites with unusual samples, such as those with multiple components, which are not handled well by seriation and require secondary interpretation. Our approach combines data from multiple projects in the Zuni region of the American Southwest in order to gauge the effects of intraregional variation in ceramic distributions and reexamine prior interpretations of demographic change based on individual projects. This analysis highlights two previously unknown regional trends, including variation in the distribution of multicomponent sites and potential short-term depopulation of a significant part of the region. Based on this example, we further suggest that our method may be particularly useful in situations where little prior chronological information is available.},

  abstract = {The study of developing complex societies can fruitfully focus on the human interactions that define communities, which have always been at the heart of settlement pattern research. Yet little attention has been paid to how communities of varying scales can actually be identified in archaeological survey data. Most often sites have simply been assumed to correspond to communities, although this practice has been criticized. Methods are offered to delineate communities at different scales systematically in survey data, and their implications for field data collection strategies are explored comparatively for cases from northeast China, Mesoamerica, and the northern Andes.}

  abstract = {[This article systematically and quantitatively characterizes interaction dynamics and community formation based on changes in spatial patterns of contemporaneous households. We develop and apply a geospatial routine to measure changing extents of household interaction and community formation from AD 600 to 1280 on the Mesa Verde cuesta in southwestern Colorado. Results suggest that household spatial organization was shaped simultaneously by the maintenance of regular social interaction that sustained communities and the need for physical space among households. Between AD 600 and 1200, households balanced these factors by forming an increased number of dispersed communities in response to population growth and variable environmental stressors. However, as population rebounded after the megadrought of the mid-1100s, communities became increasingly compact, disrupting a long-standing equilibrium between household interaction and subsistence space within each community. The vulnerabilities created by this change in community spatial organization were compounded by a cooler climate, drought, violence, and changes in political and ritual organization in the mid-1200s, which ultimately culminated in the complete depopulation of the Mesa Verde cuesta by the end of the thirteenth century. Este artículo investiga las dinámicas de la formación comunitaria a través de un análisis de los cambios diacrónicos en los patrones espaciales de las viviendas contemporáneas. Desarrollamos y aplicamos una rutina geoespacial para medir las extensiones y los patrones de interacción entre las viviendas desde dC 600 hasta 1280 en la cuesta Mesa Verde en el sudoeste de Colorado. Los resultados implican que la organización espacial entre las viviendas fue determinada simultáneamente por el mantenimiento de la interacción social habitual que sostenía las comunidades y por la separación espacial suficiente para la subsistencia de los grupos domésticos. Entre dC 600 y 1200, los grupos domésticos mantuvieron el equilibrio entre estos dos factores a través la formación de comunidades adicionales con asentamientos dispersos para mitigar varias presiones demográficas y ecológicas. Sin embargo, con el resurgimiento de la población después de la megasequía a mediados del siglo XII, las comunidades se volvieron cada vez más concentradas, alterando en cada comunidad el equilibrio existente entre la interacción de los grupos domésticos y sus espacios de subsistencia respectivos. Este cambio de la organización espacial de las comunidades generó vulnerabilidades que iban agravándose por los factores de un clima más frío, la sequía, la violencia, y otros cambios en la organización política y ritual a mediados del siglo XIII. La interacción entre estas presiones sociales y ambientales desembocó en la despoblación total de la cuesta Mesa Verde antes del fin del siglo XIII.]}

  abstract = {The consequences of climate change vary over space and time. Effective studies of human responses to climatically induced environmental change must therefore sample the environmental diversity experienced by specific societies. We reconstruct population histories from A.D. 600 to 1280 in six environmentally distinct portions of the central Mesa Verde region in southwestern Colorado, relating these to climate-driven changes in agricultural potential. In all but one subregion, increases in maize-niche size led to increases in population size. Maize-niche size is also positively correlated with regional estimates of birth rates. High birth rates continued to accompany high population levels even as productive conditions declined in the A.D. 1200s. We reconstruct prominent imbalances between the maize-niche size and population densities in two subregions from A.D. 1140 to 1180 and from A.D. 1225 to 1260. We propose that human responses in those subregions, beginning by the mid-A.D. 1200s, contributed to violence and social collapse across the entire society. Our findings are relevant to discussions of how climate change will affect contemporary societies.}

  abstract = {Using the occupation histories of 3,176 habitation sites, new estimates of maize-agriculture productivity, and an analysis of over 1,700 construction timbers, we examine the historical ecology of Pueblo peoples during their seven-century occupation (A.D. 600–1300) of a densely settled portion of the Mesa Verde archaeological region. We identify two cycles of population growth and decline, the earlier and smaller peaking in the late-A.D. 800s, the later and larger in the mid-A.D. 1200s. We also identify several episodes of immigration. Formation of aggregated settlements, which we term community centers, is positively correlated with increasing population and the time elapsed in each settlement cycle, and it persists during periods of regional population decline, but it does not correlate with climatic variation averaged over periods. Architectural and land-use practices depleted pinyon-juniper woodlands during the first cycle, but more stable field systems and greater recycling of construction timber resulted in more sustainable management of wood resources during the second cycle, despite much higher population densities. Our estimates for maize production are lower than previous estimates, especially for the A.D. 1200s, when population reached its peak in the study area. Even so, considerable potential agricultural production remained unused in the decades that immediately preceded the complete depopulation of our study area.}
