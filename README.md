## ðŸ’¾ Data availability  

Unfortunately, the locations of archaeological sites in the US count as sensitive data, so we cannot simply share them here. If you would like to use any of these data, you will need to get permission from the State Historic Preservation Offices in Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona.  

For what's it worth, you can still explore these data (with jittered locations) using the [cyberSW](https://cybersw.org/) web app.
