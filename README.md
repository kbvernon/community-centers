## ğŸ’¾ Data availability

Unfortunately, the locations of archaeological sites in the US count as
sensitive data, so we cannot simply share them here. If you would like to use
any of these data, you will need to get permission from the State Historic
Preservation Offices in Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona.

For what's it worth, you can still explore these data (with jittered locations)
using the [cyberSW](https://cybersw.org/) web app.
